Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.

Here are some of the key features of Python:

* Easy to learn and use: Python has a simple and intuitive syntax that makes it easy to learn for beginners.
* Powerful: Python is a powerful language that can be used to create a wide variety of applications.
* Flexible: Python is a flexible language that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as web development, data science, and machine learning.
* Portable: Python code can be run on a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix.
* Free and open-source: Python is a free and open-source language, which means that it is freely available to anyone to use and modify.

Python is used for a wide variety of tasks, including:

* Web development: Python is a popular language for developing web applications.
* Data science: Python is a popular language for data science, including data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
* Software development: Python is a popular language for developing software, including desktop applications, mobile applications, and games.
* Scientific computing: Python is a popular language for scientific computing, including numerical analysis, data visualization, and image processing.
* System administration: Python is a popular language for system administration, including automating tasks and managing servers.

Python is a powerful and versatile language that can be used for a wide variety of tasks. It is a great language for beginners to learn, and it is also a popular language for experienced programmers.

Here is the Python code I used to define and print the definition of Python:

```python
def what_is_python():
  print("Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.")

what_is_python()
```

This code defines a function called `what_is_python()`, which prints the definition of Python. The function is called and the definition is printed to the console.

I hope this helps!
